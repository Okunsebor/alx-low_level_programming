Dynamic Libraries in C
Dynamic libraries, also known as shared libraries, are an essential part of modern software development. They allow developers to create reusable code that can be linked with multiple programs, reducing code duplication and increasing performance.

In this project, we will explore the concept of dynamic libraries in C programming language. We will learn how to create and use dynamic libraries, and how they can be useful in real-world scenarios.

Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:

Understand the concept of dynamic libraries in C
Create a dynamic library using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)
Link a program with a dynamic library
Use the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to load a dynamic library at runtime
Use dlopen(), dlsym(), and dlclose() functions to dynamically load and unload a library at runtime
Understand the advantages and disadvantages of using dynamic libraries
Tasks
The project consists of several tasks that will guide you through the process of creating and using dynamic libraries in C. Some of the tasks include:

Creating a dynamic library containing various functions
Creating a program that uses the functions from the dynamic library
Compiling and linking the program with the dynamic library
Using the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to load the dynamic library at runtime
Using dlopen(), dlsym(), and dlclose() functions to dynamically load and unload the library at runtime
By completing these tasks, you will gain a deeper understanding of dynamic libraries and how they can be used to improve the performance and scalability of your programs.

Getting Started
To get started with the project, you will need to have a basic understanding of the C programming language and the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). You will also need to have a Linux-based operating system installed on your computer.

Once you have these prerequisites, you can start working on the tasks outlined in the project. The project repository contains a README.md file that provides detailed instructions on how to complete each task.

Conclusion
Dynamic libraries are a powerful tool in the software developer's toolkit. They allow developers to create reusable code that can be linked with multiple programs, reducing code duplication and increasing performance. By completing this project, you will gain a deeper understanding of dynamic libraries and how they can be used to improve the scalability and performance of your programs.
